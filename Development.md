   - kubectl -n default get secrets  |grep default
   - kubectl -n default edit secret default-token-dq8ck
8. This will contain ca.crt and token values which can be decoded using base64 and updated in your Config.py.

## Run:
1. Follow this document and create your first story <https://docs.storyscript.io/storyscript/writing/#basics-http-responses>.
2. Use storyscript compile -j to compile your story.
3. Update app_public.releases table with the payload generated with the above command.
